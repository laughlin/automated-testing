    "1. Create an input file containing the url's to check that is modelled off of the example sheet. Place it in the 'Inputs' folder. If you just want a feel of how to run the notebook, you can use the default examples. The input file name should be enclosed by quotes like shown and include the file extension .xlsx\n",
    "2. If you are checking a Master Lock or SentrySafe site, select whether the site to check is review or production by inputting either True or False next to the variable __IS_ML_REVIEW__. If your site is neither, leave this value as False.\n",
    "3. Select whether the site you are checking has ssl or not. Not needed if you have full url paths in the input folder.\n",
    "4. Run the check by going to 'Cell' in the top navigation and selecting 'Run All'.\n",
    "5. View what urls passed or failed the test by reading below or going to the 'Results' folder and selecting the file with the timestamp of your last run."
